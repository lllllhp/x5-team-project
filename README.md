Description: Our proposal was to create a way to store the plants that are planted in any situation from a small garden to a large mass-production farm. The program would intake the plant name, the date of it being planted, and the harvest time. From this information the program would calculate the date that the plant would need to be harvested. As more and more plants were inputed, the ones that would need to harvested first would move to the top of the list. The list would help farm owners to remember to harvest their plants on time. The program would be beneficial to optimize plant production, to yield quality and quantity results from their garden or farm.
